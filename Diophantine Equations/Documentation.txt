Diophatione Equations:- 
A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integral solutions are required.
 An Integral solution is a solution such that all the unknown variables take only integer values.
Linear Equation is of the form :- ax+by=c
Integral solution to the above equation exists iff the constant term is the multiple of hcf of the coefficients of x and y
