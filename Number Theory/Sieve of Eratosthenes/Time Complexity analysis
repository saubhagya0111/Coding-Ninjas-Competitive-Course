Time complexity analysis of Sieve of Eratosthenes:-
The loop runs for each value of i from 2 to sqrt(n) hence this changes the index of the multiples of the numbers for each (N/i) times
Example: For finding the prime numbers from 1 to N:-
Number of operations= (n/2)+(n/3)+(n/5)+........................................
                      n(1/2+1/3+1/5+1/7+..............................................................)
Sum of the above infinite series can be computed using Harmonic Progression and Taylor Series which is equal to log(log N) as N= sqrt(N)
----------------------------------Time complexity:- O(N log log N)--------------------------------------------------------------------
